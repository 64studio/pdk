Description: 64 Studio GNU/Linux Platform Development Kit (PDK)
 PDK is a platform for building specialized GNU/Linux distributions. PDK
 provides developers with a set of reusable building blocks, called components,
 which can be easily assembled into a wide variety of configurations and
 customized as necessary. It combines this componentized platform with a set
 of technologies (covering installation, software management, and hardware
 detection, with more on the way) that span traditional distribution boundaries
 and transform the assembled components into a complete distribution.
 .
 This package contains the 64 Studio GNU/Linux Platform Development Kit (PDK).
 Essentially, you can think of the PDK as "version control for
 distributions"--it's intended to be a full suite of tools for building and
 maintaining a component-based distribution, from assembling a full distro from
 a set of pre-built components to managing the evolution of the distro over time
 to incorporate upstream changes to building your own custom components to
 specifying global configuration like branding to integrating distro-specific
 patches and managing the changes over time.
