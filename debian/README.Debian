To run the acceptance tests, install all the packages named under the pdk
package suggests field. Then untar the atest.tar.gz file.

For instance:

tar zxvf atest.tar.gz
mkdir atest/packages
# Populate the atest/packages directory.
# For more info see atest/00data-catalog.sh.
# After you have done that:
python utest.py && sh run_atest -I
