This site is concerned with the 64 Studio Platform Development Kit (PDK), a Free Software tool that we use to automate the production and maintenance of several different [PdkProjects projects]. PDK is a kind of version control system for distributions, allowing us to create and manage many different custom products based on Debian and Ubuntu sources.

PDK was originally part of Componentized Linux, a platform developed at Progeny Linux Systems for building custom GNU/Linux distributions. Following the closure of Progeny in 2007, we now maintain PDK, and make it available to the Free Software development community through this site. You can [browse the PDK source](http://trac.64studio.com/pdk/browser) here. PDK is written in Python, the source code is well commented and contains documented examples. It is released under the GNU GPL, version 2.

If you are interested in PDK development, and would like write access to the PDK wiki or bug tickets, please [contact us](http://www.64studio.com/contact) at 64 Studio.
