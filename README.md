64 Studio Ltd. maintains the Platform Development Kit (PDK), a Free Software tool originally developed at Progeny Linux Systems for the automated creation and management of custom GNU/Linux distributions. 

PDK is a revision control system, with support for both Advanced Packaging Tool platforms (including Debian and Ubuntu) and RPM Package Manager platforms (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

PDK is made available to the software development community through the GitHub repository https://github.com/64studio/pdk

PDK is written in Python, the source code is well commented and contains documented examples. It is released under the GNU GPL, version 2.

If you are interested in PDK development, and would like write access to the PDK wiki or bug tickets, please [contact us](http://www.64studio.com/contact) at 64 Studio.
