64 Studio Ltd. maintains the Platform Development Kit (PDK), a Free Software tool originally developed at Progeny Linux Systems for the automated creation and management of custom GNU/Linux distributions. 

PDK is a revision control system, with support for both Advanced Packaging Tool platforms (including Debian and Ubuntu) and RPM Package Manager platforms (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

Following the closure of Progeny in 2007, PDK is now made available to the software development community through the GitHub repository https://github.com/64studio/pdk
